# SmartFarm

An app prototype designed as a solution for challenge 2 of Digital Fields Hack, an hackathon competition held on 27 and 28 October 2018 in Bologna (Italy). For further information about this event, refer to **Hackathon Infos** folder.


## Challenge 2

As participants involved in the second challenge, we needed to improve and enhance user-experience following these criteria:
* Ease of use and fast comprehension of in-app data, taken from field sensors
* Possibility to further analyze field data, visualizing correlation between them and trends
* Graphic restyling to help user associate physical characteristics of crop and fruits with data
